 # Hey, I'm Priyank 👋

  Founder & CTO at [RubixKube](https://rubixkube.ai). Building Site Reliability Intelligence (SRI).

  ## What I'm building

  RubixKube is an AI-native platform that gives engineering teams intelligence over their
  infrastructure. Not another dashboard. Not another alerting tool. A system that understands your
  infrastructure, learns from every incident, and acts before things break.

  We're defining a new category: **Site Reliability Intelligence**. The idea is simple. Monitoring
  tells you something broke. SRI tells you why, what's next, and how to prevent it.

  The platform runs on a modular AI agent mesh, a contextual memory engine, and an event-driven
  architecture designed for production from day one. Multi-tenant, HA, built to scale.

  ## What I care about

  - Distributed systems and the hard problems that come with them
  - AI that actually works in production, not demos
  - Event-driven architecture, Kubernetes, Go, Python
  - Building tools that give engineers their weekends back
  - Category creation. If the market doesn't have what you need, define it.

  ## Previously

  Product architect and systems engineer. Deep background in Kubernetes, cloud-native
  infrastructure, and fullstack development. Spent years in the trenches before deciding to build
  the tool I wished existed.
